This subfolder contain the scripts and data to process the danish datacall for fisheries management measures in the 5 Natura 2000 sites located in the North Sea for the protection of reef structures (sandbanks H1110/ stone reefs H1170 and bubbling reefs H1180).
We very much hope for your cooperation and will appreciate, if the requested data can be forwarded to us before 23th october 2017.

To calculate the output, 3 R-Scripts are provided, but only 1 is mandatory - 1_ExtractDataFromScenarios.R. This will extract data from a combined vms and logbook data in the 5 areas and aggregate it by year, gear and gearGroup. The data extracted is the following:
-          Number of vessels
-          Effort (hours)
-          Landings (total weight in KG) and landing values (Euro) by species 
-          VMS data positions with assumed fishing activity (after speed filter is applied).

The two other R-Scripts will do the following:
0_CombineTacsatAndEflalo.R will combine cleaned vms points with cleaned logbook data. This is a new approach, so each country should decide which way they want to do it. Please also have a look at this webpage: https://github.com/nielshintzen/vmstools/wiki/Practicals1
2_MakeOutputFiles.R will use the output from 1_ExtractDataFromScenarios.R, and make it into a more readable format. No new information is extracted in this script.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. In case of any technical questions or comments, please contact Jeppe Olsen (jepol@aqua.dtu.dk). In case of any procedural questions, please contact Adam Billing (ADABIL@lfst.dk)
